# Profile Page & Banner Updates

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive user profile system to enhance user experience and provide essential account management capabilities.
(Small aesthetic change on the Pingpong banner as well.)

## Rationale
- **User Experience**: Users needed a centralized place to manage their account information and view game statistics
- **Visual Identity**: Banner avatar display provides immediate user recognition and personalization
- **Data Management**: Required secure avatar upload and profile editing capabilities
- **Game Analytics**: Users needed to track their performance across different game modes

## Key Changes Made

### Profile Page (`/profile`)
- **Custom Image Cropper**: Built canvas-based circular avatar cropping with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Real-time Data Sync**: Automatic user information updates with error handling
- **Tabbed Statistics**: Organized game data into PVC/PVP, Tournaments, and Charts tabs
- **Account Management**: Phone number editing and secure account deletion
- **Friends Integration**: Real-time friends list with online/offline status

### Banner/Header Integration
- **Dynamic Avatar Display**: Shows user avatar in header when authenticated
- **Authentication States**: Different icons for logged in/out states
- **Real-time Updates**: Avatar changes reflect immediately across the application

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components
- **ImageEditor Class**: Custom canvas-based cropper with circular masking
- **Profile Class**: Main profile management with data fetching and display
- **UserSettings Component**: Banner avatar display with authentication states
- **SPA Integration**: Real-time avatar synchronization across components

### Data Flow
1. **Avatar Upload**: Canvas cropping → Base64 encoding → Backend storage
2. **Profile Sync**: Automatic data fetching → Real-time display updates
3. **Banner Updates**: Avatar changes → Immediate header reflection

### API Integration
- `GET /gateway/auth/user` - User information
- `POST /gateway/auth/profile` - Avatar/phone updates
- `GET /gateway/score/score` - Game statistics
- `GET /gateway/score/tournament/user` - Tournament data

## Performance Considerations
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic compression (80% JPEG quality)
- **Lazy Loading**: Images load only when needed
- **Caching**: User data cached to reduce API calls
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for network issues

## Testing Completed
- Avatar upload with various image formats and sizes
- Real-time data synchronization across components
- Responsive design on different screen sizes
- Authentication state management
- Error handling for network failures

## Changes to packages
npm install chart.js (in the frontend directory)


I also did some changes to Usersettings.ts and SPA.ts but idk if they were necessary.
